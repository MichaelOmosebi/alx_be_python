# Objective: Deepen your understanding of inheritance and composition in Python by creating a system that models a library with different types of books.

# Task Description:
# Develop two Python scripts: library_system.py and main.py. In library_system.py, youâ€™ll define a base class Book and two derived classes, EBook and PrintBook, showcasing inheritance. Additionally, implement a Library class demonstrating composition by managing a collection of books.

# library_system.py:
# Base Class - Book:

# Attributes: title (str) and author (str).
# Method: __init__(self, title, author) for initializing book attributes.
# Derived Classes - EBook and PrintBook:

# Both classes inherit from Book.
# EBook additional attribute: file_size (int).
# PrintBook additional attribute: page_count (int).
# Each derived class should have its own __init__ method that properly calls the base class __init__ while also initializing its unique attribute.
# Composition - Library:

# Attributes: books (a list to store instances of Book, EBook, and PrintBook).
# Methods:
# add_book(self, book): Adds a Book, EBook, or PrintBook instance to the library.
# list_books(self): Prints details of each book in the library.

class Book:
    def __init__(self, title: str, author: str) -> None:
        """Constructor to initialize the book's title and author."""

        self.author = author

        """Prints details of each book in the library."""
        for book in self.books:
            book_type = type(book).__name__
            print(f"{book_type}: {book}")
