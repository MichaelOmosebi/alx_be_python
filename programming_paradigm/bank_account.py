# Class Definition:

# Define a class named BankAccount.
# Use the __init__ method to initialize an account_balance attribute. Optionally, accept an initial balance parameter, defaulting to zero.
# Encapsulation and Behaviors:

# Implement deposit(amount), withdraw(amount), and display_balance() methods.
# deposit should add the specified amount to account_balance.
# withdraw should deduct the amount from account_balance if funds are sufficient, returning True; otherwise, return False and do not alter the balance.
# display_balance should print the current balance in a user-friendly format.

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):
        self.account_balance = initial_balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.account_balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= self.account_balance:
            self.account_balance -= amount
            return True
        return False

    def display_balance(self):
        print(f"Current Balance: ${self.account_balance:.2f}")
